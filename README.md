## AI-INTERNAL-AFFAIRS
My "Building AI course" project
An attempt to create an AI tool to fight against bias in media articles, social network posts, web pages descriptions....

## Summary
We all have some unconscious gender biases which we can not notice when we speak or write up. To break out this harmful chain, we'll create an AI tool to identify these unconscious biases.

## Background
In our daily life we can find instances of unconscious male chauvinism such as a newspaper article about the last World Economic Forum describing females outfits but not their males partners. Most of times those are unconscious but they are harmful anyways. They are contributing to perpetuate gender inequalty.

## How is it used?
It works as a single grammar checker or writing assistant. 
It will be useful for anyone writing up and posting articles, master cases, end of degree works... or even novels. 

# write your solution here
Internal Affairs (IA) pretends to be an AI tool that uses machine learning to help anyone to avoid unconscious gender biases.
Using Natural Language Processing and neural network for classify the texts in gender balanced or unbalanced.
The model will be trained with data sets from accredited authors and organizations such as UN Women, Women or Faculty Forum (yale university)

## Challenges
Expanding across languages 

## What next?
To make it able to work in any language.
